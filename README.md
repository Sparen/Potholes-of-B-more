# Potholes of B'More #

Welcome to Potholes of B'More, my (Andrew Fan/Sparen of Ir√≠a) tentative submission for HopHacks Fall 2015, held from Sept 11 to Sept 13 at Johns Hopkins University.

This is a thing (for a lack of a better word - it doesn't quality as a 'hack' given the sheer number of problems with it) that marks years worth of Baltimore City Pothole Data (see: [Baltimore City Open Data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/City-Services/City-potholes/uds6-qsb6)) on a map using Google Maps's API.

# Contributions? #

Unfortunately, this repo is closed to contributors as it is for a hackathon and most likely, will still be completely broken _after_ the hackathon has finished.
